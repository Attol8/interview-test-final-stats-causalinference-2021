# Just Eat Technical Code Challenge

This repository contains code with answers to the questions posed in the Just Eat Tech code challenge. 

Part A - Files with answers:

* **interview-test-final\interview_test_final.py** contains the model training implementation of two classifiers (RF and Logistic Regression)
* **interview-test-final\interview_test_dominant_features.ipynb** is a notebook in which I explain the dominant features for classifiers
* **interview-test-final\interview_test_model_evaluations.ipynb** is a notebook in which I evaluate and compare the different trained classifiers

Part B - Files with answers:

* **interview-test-final\interview_test_partB.ipynb** is a notebook containing all the answers to questions from Part B on causal Inference
